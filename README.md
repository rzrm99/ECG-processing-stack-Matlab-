# ECG + HRV Advanced Pipeline (MATLAB)

> **One-file demo** of a full ECG processing stack: realistic signal synthesis, denoising, QRS detection, HRV metrics (time/frequency/nonlinear), a simple AF-like irregularity screen, and rich visualizations — all in `ecg_hrv_pipeline.m`.

---

##  What’s inside

- **Signal synthesis**: Realistic ECG beats with RR variability (LF/HF) or AF-like jitter, plus common noise (baseline wander, powerline, white noise).
- **Denoising**: Baseline removal, 50/60 Hz notch, bandpass (QRS emphasis).
- **QRS detection**: Pan–Tompkins–style enhancement + adaptive thresholding and refractory handling; peak refinement on filtered ECG.
- **HRV analysis**:
  - Time domain: `meanNN`, `SDNN`, `RMSSD`, `pNN50`
  - Frequency domain (Welch PSD, LF/HF bands): `LFnu`, `HFnu`, band centers & powers
  - Nonlinear: Poincaré `SD1`, `SD2`
- **AF-like screen (heuristic)**: Flags when RR variability is high, autocorrelation low, and pNN50 elevated.
- **Visualization**: Noisy vs. clean ECG, filtered ECG with R-peaks, QRS-enhancement trace + threshold, tachogram, HRV PSD, Poincaré plot, LF/HF bars.

##  Quick start

1. Save the file as **`ecg_hrv_pipeline.m`**.
2. Open in **MATLAB** (R2019b+ recommended).
3. Press **Run** (F5).

The script detects whether the **Signal Processing Toolbox** is available.  
If yes, it uses `butter`, `filtfilt`, and `iirnotch`.  
If not, it falls back to robust moving-median/mean detrending and simple sinus fit for notch removal.

---

##  Requirements

- **MATLAB** (tested with 360 Hz sampling; any modern version should work)
- **Optional**: Signal Processing Toolbox (for zero-phase IIR filtering)

No external data files needed — the ECG is synthesized.

## Usage

All parameters live at the top of the file:

```matlab
% -------------------- PARAMETERS --------------------
fs      = 360;      % sampling rate (Hz)
dur_s   = 180;      % duration (s)
hr_bpm  = 70;       % nominal heart rate
af_mode = false;    % true -> generate AF-like irregularity

% HRV (RR variability) settings
sdnn_ms = 60;       % target SDNN (ms)
lf_hz   = 0.1;      % LF modulation (~Mayer)
hf_hz   = 0.25;     % HF modulation (respiratory)

% Noise settings
add_baseline_wander = true;  baseline_amp_mV = 0.15; baseline_hz = 0.35;
add_powerline       = true;  powerline_freq  = 50;   powerline_amp_mV = 0.05;
```

##  Examples

```text
Default (sinus rhythm)
    Just run ecg_hrv_pipeline.

AF-like rhythm
    Set af_mode = true.

North America mains
    Set powerline_freq = 60.

Shorter demo
    Set dur_s = 60.
```

##  Methods (high level)

```text
RR generation:
    Quasi-sinusoidal LF/HF modulations or AF-like random jitter;
    rescaled to target SDNN.

ECG morphology:
    Sum of Gaussian lobes for P/Q/R/S/T around R-times;
    slight beat-to-beat variability added.

Filtering:
    High-pass (~0.5 Hz) for baseline wander
    Notch at 50/60 Hz (Q≈30)
    Bandpass ~5–25 Hz for QRS emphasis

QRS detection:
    Differentiate → square → moving integration (~120 ms) →
    adaptive threshold + refractory (~200 ms) →
    local-max refinement on bandpassed ECG.

HRV frequency:
    Interpolate NN to 4 Hz; Welch PSD;
    integrate LF (0.04–0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15–0.40 Hz);
    compute normalized units and band centroids.

Poincaré:
    SD1/SD2 via rotated coordinates.

AF-like screen (heuristic):
    cv(RR), pNN50, and lag-1 autocorrelation thresholding
    (informal; not a medical diagnostic).

##  Notes & Caveats

```text
Educational/research demo only.
The AF-like screen is a simple heuristic and must NOT be used for clinical purposes.

Peak detection parameters (integration window, refractory time, bandpass edges)
are reasonable defaults for 360 Hz; adjust for other sampling rates or morphologies.

Frequency-domain metrics depend on duration; ≥3–5 minutes recommended for stable LF/HF estimates.

If you disable SPT, filtering still works but is cruder; expect slightly different peaks and HRV numbers.
```

---

##  Troubleshooting

```text
Too few NN intervals warning:
    Increase dur_s, reduce noise, or adjust filtering.

Missed/extra R-peaks:
    Tweak win_ms, refractory time in detect_r_peaks, or bandpass edges.

Powerline not fully removed:
    Ensure powerline_freq matches your region (50 vs 60 Hz).
    With SPT, notch quality is better.
